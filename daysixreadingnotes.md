# Javascript

-Javascript is a lightweight, interperted, or just in time compiled programming
language with first class functions.
- application programming interfaces or APIs are ready made sets of code building blocks that allow a developer to implement.
- browser APIs and third party APIs
- runs code from top to bottom
- Save files APP.js
## Interpreted versus Compiled

-Interpreted you dont have to transfrom it for the browser to use it.
-Compiled you have to transform it.

### Varibles

- Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst. The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015. The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015. If you want your code to run in older browser, you must use var.
- If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const. If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.
